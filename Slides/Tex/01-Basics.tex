  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Confidence}: You will feel like you have a good enough understanding of diff-in-diff and synthetic control, both in its basics and some more contemporary issues, so that by the end of the week it a very intuitive, friendly, and useful tool
    \item \textbf{Comprehension}: You will have learned a lot both conceptually and in the specifics, particularly with regards to issues around identification and estimation in the diff-in-diff and synth context
    \item \textbf{Competency}: You will have more knowledge of programming syntax in Stata and R so that later you can apply this in your own work

\subsection{Introducing difference-in-differences}



\begin{frame}{What is difference-in-differences (DiD)}

\begin{itemize}
\item DiD is a very old, relatively straightforward, intuitive research design
\item A group of units are assigned some treatment and then compared to a group of units that weren't
\item One of the most widely used quasi-experimental methods in economics and increasingly in industry
\item Mostly associated with ``big shocks'' happening in space over time
\end{itemize}


\begin{quote}
``A good way to do econometrics is to look for good natural experiments and use statistical methods that can tidy up the confounding factors that nature has not controlled for us.'' -- Daniel McFadden (Nobel Laureate recipient with Heckman 2002)
\end{quote}

\begin{frame}{Origins of diff-in-diff}

\begin{itemize}
\item Difference-in-differences (DiD) was quietly and largely unnoticed introduced in the 19th century as a way to convince skeptics in health policy arguments
\item Dominant disease theory in 19th century was \emph{miasma} -- disease caused by smelly vapor
\item Keep in mind -- microorganisms would not be identified until much later, partly caused by poor resolution in microscopes (Freedman 2007)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Miasma I: Ignaz Semmelweis and washing hands}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1840s, Vienna maternity wards had high postpartum infections in one wing compared to other wings
\item One division had doctors and trainee doctors, but another had midwives and trainee midwives
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Miasma I: Ignaz Semmelweis and washing hands}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ignaz Semmelweis notes the difference in 1841 when hospitals moved to ``anatomical'' training involving cadavers (Pamela Jakeila lecture notes on DiD)
\item New training happens to one but not the other and Semmelweis thinks the mortality is caused by working with cadavers
\item Proposes washing hands with chlorine in 1847 in the midwives' wing and uses a DiD design of pre and post
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Miasma II: John Snow and cholera}

\begin{itemize}
\item Three major waves of cholera in the early to mid 1800s in London
\item John Snow believed cholera was spread through the Thames water supply which contradicted dominant theory about ``dirty air'' transmission
\item Grand experiment: Lambeth moves its pipe between 1849 and 1854; Southwark and Vauxhall delay
\item He can evaluate the effect in three ways (one of which is DiD)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference-in-differences and empirical crisis in labor economics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Empirical crisis in empirical labor back in the 1970s (26:31 to 32:00)  \\ \url{https://youtu.be/1soLdywFb_Q?t=1579}
\item Orley Ashenfelter graduated from Princeton in the 1970s, takes a job in Washington DC and begins studying ``job trainings programs'' where he develops the difference-in-differences design
\item Listen to Orley explain the connection he made between twoway fixed effects and difference-in-differences; it was born out of a need to explain OLS to an American bureaucrat
\\ \url{https://youtu.be/WnB3EJ8K7lg?t=126}

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Steps of a project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert research question into causal parameter
\item Deduce beliefs needed to estimate that causal parameter with data
\item Create a calculator that will use data and estimate the causal parameter
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Most of us skip (1) and maybe even (2) and instead simply ``run regressions'' and cross our fingers that that coefficient is causal, but is it? And why is it?  And what is it?  Let's dig into Orley's comment a little more. 

\end{frame}

\subsection{Potential outcomes}

\begin{frame}{Equivalence}
$$Y_{ist} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \textcolor{blue}{\delta} (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} $$

\bigskip

$$\widehat{\textcolor{blue}{\delta}} = \bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{pre(k)} \bigg ) - \bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{pre(k)} \bigg ) $$

\begin{itemize}
\item Orley claims that the OLS estimator of $\delta$ and the ``four averages and three subtractions'' are the same thing numerically
\item And they are -- they are numerically \emph{identical}
\item And under a particular assumption, they are also unbiased estimates of an aggregate causal parameter
\item But to see this we need new notation -- potential outcomes
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the treatment be a binary variable: $$D_{i,t} =\begin{cases} 1 \text{ if in job training program $t$} \\ 0 \text{ if not in job training program at time $t$} \end{cases}$$where $i$ indexes an individual observation, such as a person

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}

	\item Potential outcomes: $$Y_{i,t}^j =\begin{cases} 1 \text{: wages at time $t$ if trained} \\ 0 \text{: wages at time $t$ if not trained} \end{cases}$$where $j$ indexes a counterfactual state of the world

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Treatment effect definitions}


	\begin{block}{Individual treatment effect}
	    The individual treatment effect,  $\delta_i$, equals $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$
	\end{block}

Missing data problem:  I don't know my own counterfactual
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conditional Average Treatment Effects}	
	\begin{block}{Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)}
	The average treatment effect on the treatment group is equal to the average treatment effect conditional on being a treatment group member:
		\begin{eqnarray*}
		E[\delta|D=1]&=&E[Y^1-Y^0|D=1] \nonumber \\
		&=&E[Y^1|D=1]-\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0|D=1]}
		\end{eqnarray*}
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip

This is one of the most important policy parameters, if not the most important, and coincidentally it's also the parameter you get with diff-in-diff (even with heterogeneity)

	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes vs data}

\begin{itemize}
\item ATT is expressed in terms of potential outcomes, but we do not use potential outcomes for estimation; we use data
\item Potential outcomes are unknown and \emph{hypothetical} possibilities describing states of the world but our data are realized outcomes, or ``data'', that actually occurred
\item Potential outcomes become realized under treatment assignment $$Y_{it}=D_{it}Y_{it}^1 + (1-D_{it})Y_{it}^0$$
\item Depending on how the treatment is assigned really dictates whether correlations reveal causal effects or bias

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Estimation}


\begin{frame}{DiD equation}

Orley's ``four averages and three subtractions'', or what Bacon will call the 2x2

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} = \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}$k$ are the people in the job training program, $U$ are the untreated people not in the program, $Post$ is after the trainees took the class, $Pre$ is the period just before they took the class, and $E[y]$ is mean earnings. 

\bigskip

Does $\widehat{\delta}$ equal the ATT?  If so when? If not why not?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes and the switching equation}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^0_U | Post ] - E[ Y^0_U | Pre]}_{\mathclap{\text{Switching equation}}} \bigg)  \\
&&+ \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y_k^0 |Post] - E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{Adding zero}}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parallel trends bias}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \underbrace{E[Y^1_k | Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{ATT}}} \\
&& + \bigg [  \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]} - E[Y^0_k | Pre] \bigg ] - \bigg [ E[Y^0_U | Post] - E[Y_U^0 | Pre] }_{\mathclap{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in 2x2 case}}} \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification through parallel trends}
	

	\begin{block}{Parallel trends}
	Assume two groups, treated and comparison group, then we define parallel trends as:	 $$\textcolor{red}{E(}\textcolor{red}{\Delta Y^0_k)} = E(\Delta Y^0_U)$$
	\end{block}

\textbf{In words}: ``The \textcolor{red}{evolution of earnings for our trainees \emph{had they not trained}} is the same as the evolution of mean earnings for non-trainees''.  

\bigskip

It's in \textcolor{red}{red} because parallel trends is untestable and critically important to estimation of the ATT using any method, OLS or ``four averages and three subtractions''

	

	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Work together \#1}

Work together: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}Assume that the $U$ group is treated in both periods.  Replace expectations with potential outcomes and rewrite using the ``add zero'' trick we did.  How is this similar to what we did before?  Is parallel trends enough?


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Work together \#2}

Work together: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}In the pre-period, how important is it that the $U$ group and $k$ group have the same treatment status?  


\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{What is parallel trends}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends assumes away the selection bias associated with comparisons
\item The assumption is thought to be more plausible than simply assuming simple comparisons held equal $E[Y^0|D=0]=E[Y^0|D=1]$
\item But it is still a strong assumption, and differs from the assumptions have in the RCT which though also untestable, is nearly guaranteed by randomization
\item Most of the hard part of the work involves the old fashioned detective work and the work of making good arguments with good exhibits (tables and figures)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Understanding parallel trends through worksheets}

Before we move into regression, let's go through a simple exercise to really pin down these core ideas with simple calculations

\bigskip 

\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onabpc14JdrGo6NFv0zCWo-nuWDLLV2L1qNogDT9SBw/edit?usp=sharing}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{No Anticipation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Additional assumption is ``no anticipation'' -- poorly named as it doesn't require literally no anticipation
\item No anticipation means that the treatment effect happens only at the time that the treatment occurs or after, but not before
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Example 1}: Tomorrow I win the lottery, but don't get paid yet. I decide to buy a new house today. That violates NA
	\item \textbf{Example 2}: Next year, a state lets you drive without a driver license and you know it. But you can't drive without a driver license today.  This satisfies NA.
	\end{itemize}
\item We need NA because we are comparing to a baseline period and it needs to not be treated
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{SUTVA}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Imbens and Rubin 2015) focuses on what happens when in our analysis we are combining units (versus defining treatment effects)
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{No Interference}: a treated unit cannot impact a control unit such that their potential outcomes change (unstable treatment value)
	\item \textbf{No hidden variation in treatment}: When units are indexed to receive a treatment, their dose is the same as someone else with that same index
	\item \textbf{Scale}: If scaling causes interference or changes inputs in production process, then \#1 or \#2 are violated
	\end{enumerate}
\item Shifts from defining treatment effects to estimating them, which means being careful about who is the control group, how you define treatments and what questions can and cannot be answered with this method
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{OLS Specification}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Simple DiD equation will identify ATT under parallel trends
	\item But so will a particular OLS specification (two groups and no covariates)
	\item OLS was historically preferred because
		\begin{itemize}
		\item OLS estimates the ATT under parallel trends
		\item Easy to calculate the standard errors
		\item Easy to include multiple periods
		\end{itemize}
	\item People liked it also because of differential timing, continuous treatments and covariates, but those are more complex so we address them later
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Minimum wages}

\begin{itemize}
\item Card and Krueger (1994) have a famous study estimating causal effect (ATT) of minimum wages on employment
\item Let's listen to Card tell its origin \\ \url{https://youtu.be/1soLdywFb_Q?t=2680}
\item Exploited a policy change in New Jersey between February and November in mid-1990s where minimum wage was increased, but neighbor PA did not
\item Using DiD, they do not find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment which is part of its legacy today, but I mainly present it to illustrate the history and the design principles
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./lecture_includes/minwage_whore}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Reaction to the paper}

\begin{itemize}

\item Was it or was it not controversial?  Yes and no

\item Orley's opinion about the paper's controversy at the time.  \\ \url{https://youtu.be/MOtbuRX4eyQ?t=1882}

\item What Card and Krueger \emph{experienced} 

\url{https://youtu.be/1soLdywFb_Q?t=3076}



\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Card on that study}

\begin{quote}
``I’ve subsequently stayed away from the minimum wage literature for a number of reasons. First, it cost me a lot of friends. People that I had known for many years, for instance, some of the ones I met at my first job at the University of Chicago, became very angry or disappointed. They thought that in publishing our work we were being traitors to the cause of economics as a whole.''
\end{quote}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{OLS specification of the DiD equation}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The correctly specified OLS regression is an interaction with time and group fixed effects:$$Y_{its} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta (NJ \times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{its}$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item NJ is a dummy equal to 1 if the observation is from NJ
		\item d is a dummy equal to 1 if the observation is from November (the post period)
		\end{itemize}
	\item This equation takes the following values
		\begin{itemize}
		\item PA Pre: $\alpha$
		\item PA Post: $\alpha + \lambda$
		\item NJ Pre: $\alpha + \gamma$
		\item NJ Post: $\alpha + \gamma + \lambda + \delta$
		\end{itemize}
	\item DiD equation: (NJ Post - NJ Pre) - (PA Post - PA Pre) $= \delta$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[plain]
	$$Y_{ist} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta(NJ\times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{ist}$$
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.90]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_5.pdf}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[plain]
	$$Y_{ist} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta(NJ\times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{ist}$$
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.90]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_5.pdf}
	\end{figure}

Notice how OLS is ``imputing'' $E[Y^0|D=1,Post]$ for the treatment group in the post period? It is only ``correct'', though, if parallel trends is a good approximation

\end{frame}

\subsection{Inference}

\begin{frame}{Introduction to Inference in DID}
  When dealing with clustered data, a crucial concept is the difference between correlated observations and correlated errors. While they may seem similar, they are distinct, and it's essential to focus on the errors when clustering standard errors.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Correlated Observations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Correlated observations occur when the observed variables themselves are correlated within a cluster.
    \item For instance, incomes within a specific region might be positively correlated.
    \item Correlated observations do not necessarily violate OLS assumptions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Correlated Errors}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Correlated errors occur when the unobserved errors are correlated within a cluster.
    \item This violates the classical OLS assumption of independent errors, leading to inefficient and possibly biased standard errors.
    \item Clustering standard errors accounts for this within-cluster correlation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Focus on Correlated Errors?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OLS assumptions are about errors, not the observed variables.
    \item Failing to account for correlated errors can lead to misleading inference.
    \item Clustering standard errors at the appropriate level corrects for this, giving more reliable hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Serial correlation creates problems}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item So errors within a cluster (e.g., same treatment group) might be correlated.
    \item Even if between clusters, they are assumed to be independent, the within correlation in errors biases standard errors downward
	\item  Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004) show that conventional standard errors will often severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators
	\item They proposed three solutions, but most only use one of them (clustering)

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Inference}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[1 ] Block bootstrapping standard errors (if you analyze states the block should be the states and you would sample whole states with replacement for bootstrapping)
		\item[2 ] Clustering standard errors at the group level (in Stata one would simply add \texttt{, cluster(state)} to the regression equation if one analyzes state level variation)
		\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Most people will simply cluster, but there are issues if you have too few clusters. They mention a third way but it's only a curiosity.
		
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Computing Cluster-Robust Standard Errors}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Run your regression to get \( u \) and \( \hat{Y} \).
    \item Calculate cluster-level residuals \( \hat{u}_c \).
    \item Calculate the "meat" (as in bread-meat-bread sandwich) \( M \) as \( \sum_c X_c^\prime \hat{u}_c \hat{u}_c^\prime X_c \).
    \item Your standard error covariance matrix is \( \hat{V} = (X^\prime X)^{-1} M (X^\prime X)^{-1} \).
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \bigskip
  
  Mixtape reference (chapter 2): \url{https://mixtape.scunning.com/02-probability\_and\_regression\#cluster-robust-standard-errors}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compressing Into a Single Number}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Diagonal elements of \( \hat{V} \) contain variances for each coefficient.
    \item Standard errors are the square root of these diagonal elements.
    \item Non-diagonal elements are used for hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for combinations of coefficients.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\section{Parallel trends violations}

\subsection{How parallel trends can get violated}


\begin{frame}{Violating parallel trends exercise}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends are needed so we can impute the missing $E[Y^0|D=1]$ with $E[Y^0|D=0]$ either explicitly or implicitly
\item Which means if parallel trends isn't true, then the imputation isn't correct and therefore estimates are biased
\item To illustrate this, let's go through the document again

\begin{frame}{Violating parallel trends}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends are in expectation only -- we don't rely everybody to follow the same trend, just that the group average for $Y^0$ be approximately the same for treated and control 
\item Violations are a form of selection bias and there are two straightforward ways that parallel trends will be violated
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compositional differences in samples associated with repeated cross-sections
	\item Policy endogeneity
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Repeated cross-sections and compositional change}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One of the risks of a repeated cross-section is that the composition of the sample may have changed between the pre and post period in ways that are correlated with treatment
	\item Hong (2013) uses repeated cross-sectional data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) containing music expenditure and internet use for a random sample of households
	\item Study exploits the emergence of Napster (first file sharing software widely used by Internet users) in June 1999 as a natural experiment
	\item Study compares internet users and internet non-users before and after emergence of Napster

\begin{frame}{Repeated cross-sections}

\begin{itemize}
\item Surprisingly underappreciated problem with almost no literature around it
\item So what can you do?  Check covariate balance by regressing the time-varying covariates instead of the outcome onto the treatment using your OLS specification
\item They should be exogenous remember, so this covariate regression can be a helpful test of whether this is a problem
\item ``Difference-in-differences with Compositional Changes'' by Pedro Sant'anna and Qi Xu (not yet released) is the only paper I've ever seen to look into it

\begin{frame}{Types of evidence}

\begin{itemize}
\item You are building a case, the prosecutor before a judge and jury, always in battle with the defense attorney
\item Evidence has particular broadly defined forms that can help you on the front end

\begin{frame}{Intuition behind event studies}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Princeton Industrial Relations Section seems to be behind this -- this intense focus on research design but also verifying assumptions
	\item The identifying assumption for all DD designs is parallel trends , but since we cannot verify parallel trends, we often look at pre-trends
	\item It's a type of check for selection bias, but you must understand what it is and what it isn't to see its value but not be naive about it (it is not a silver bullet)
	\item Even if pre-trends are the same one still has to worry about other policies changing at the same time (omitted variable bias is a parallel trends violation)

\end{itemize}

\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onabpc14JdrGo6NFv0zCWo-nuWDLLV2L1qNogDT9SBw/edit?usp=sharing}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Beware of naive reasoning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel pre-trends $\neq$ parallel trends -- these are often thought to be the same thing, and they aren't
\item Equating them is a kind of \emph{post hoc ergo propter hoc} fallacy
\item Parallel pre-trends is more like a smoking gun based on things ``looking the same'' before
\item Similar to checking for covariate balance in RCTs
\item But \textbf{cannot} substitute for domain knowledge!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Event study regression}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Event studies have a simple OLS specification with only one treatment group and one never-treated group $$Y_{its} = \alpha +  \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item where $D$ is an interaction of the treatment group $s$ with the calendar year $\tau$
		\item Treatment occurs in year 0, no anticipation, drop baseline $t-1$
		\item Includes $q$ leads or anticipatory effects and $m$ lags or post treatment effects
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event study regression}


$$Y_{its} = \alpha + \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$

\bigskip

Typically you'll plot the coefficients and 95\% CI on all leads and lags (binned or not, trimmed or not) 

\bigskip

Under no anticipation, then you expect $\widehat{\mu}$ coefficients to be zero, which gives you confidence that parallel trends holds (but is not a guarantee, and there are still specification issues -- see Jon Roth's work)

\bigskip

Under parallel trends, $\widehat{\delta}$ are estimates of the ATT at points in time

\begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Rational addiction as a placebo critique}


Sometimes, an empirical literature may be criticized using nothing more than placebo analysis

\begin{quote}``A majority of [our] respondents believe the literature is a success story that demonstrates the power of economic reasoning.  At the same time, they also believe the empirical evidence is weak, and they disagree both on the type of evidence that would validate the theory and the policy implications. Taken together, this points to an interesting gap.  On the one hand, most of the respondents claim that the theory has valuable real world implications.  On the other hand, they do not believe the theory has received empirical support.''
